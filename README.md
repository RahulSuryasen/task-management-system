Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
Click on the + icon at the top right and select New repository.
Name your repository (e.g., task-management-system) and set it to public (or private if you prefer).
Optionally, add a description of your project.
Initialize the repository with a README.md (you can update it later).
Click on Create repository.
Step 2: Prepare Your Local Project Directory
Make sure your project is ready for upload and is in a local directory on your computer.

If you don't already have a Git repository initialized, navigate to your project folder in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/project
Initialize Git in your project folder:

bash
Copy code
git init
Add all project files to the Git staging area:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the files with a message:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit with project files"
Step 3: Link to GitHub Repository and Push
In your terminal, link your local repository to the GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-system.git
Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username.

Push your changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
If prompted for authentication, use your GitHub personal access token (as GitHub removed password authentication).

Step 4: Add or Update the README.md
Once your project is uploaded to GitHub, you can update the README.md to include detailed instructions for setting up and running your project locally. Here's a sample README.md:

# Task Management System

A simple web-based **Task Management System** built to help users organize and track their tasks. This application allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks, providing a straightforward interface for task management.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks by specifying a title and description.
- **Task Listing**: View a list of all tasks with their details.
- **Task Editing**: Edit an existing task to update the title or description.
- **Task Deletion**: Delete tasks when they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Task Status**: Users can mark tasks as "Completed" or "Pending".
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to manage their own tasks securely.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap (For responsive UI)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Flask (Python web framework)
  
- **Database**:
  - SQLite (For storing tasks data)
  
- **Other Tools**:
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy (For ORM-based database management)
  - Jinja2 (For dynamic HTML rendering)

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the Task Management System locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- SQLite (usually included with Python)

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd task-management-system
Install the required dependencies: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application: After installing the dependencies, you can start the Flask development server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application: Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You should see the Task Management System interface, where you can create, view, and manage tasks.

Usage
Create a Task: Click on the "Create Task" button, fill in the task title and description, then click "Save".
Edit a Task: Click on an existing task from the list, make changes, and save.
Delete a Task: Click on the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
Mark a Task as Completed: Click on the task to toggle its status between "Pending" and "Completed".
